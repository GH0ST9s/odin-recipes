        <h1>Cacio e Pepe Taralli</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Often served with (and dipped in!) white wine, taralli are a fun and versatile Italian snack<br>you can flavor all sorts of ways. This pepper and cheese variety starts with a simple<br>unleavened dough starring white wine and olive oil. Rolled into ropes, then into rings,<br>they're boiled and sprinkled with cheese before baking. Once baked, the cheese forms a<br>crispy wafer in the middle of the ring!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl, and stir with a spoon to<br>combine. Pour in wine and olive oil. Mix until dough starts to come together.<br>Knead by hand until dough is smooth and slightly elastic, about 3 minutes. Wrap<br>dough in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
            <br><li>Unwrap dough and cut into 4 pieces. Roll each piece out with your palms into<br>ropes about 10 to 12 inches long. Cut each rope into 3 pieces; roll each piece to a<br>length of 5 or 6 inches. Twist the ends a few times and press them together<br>to form a ring, twisting as needed to fully seal the ends. </li>
            <br><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a<br>silicone mat (such as SILPATÂ®). </li>
            <br><li>Bring a pan of water (at least 3 inches) to a boil. Drop in 4 rings of dough at a<br>time. Boil until rings float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted<br>spoon onto a towel-lined plate. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. </li>
            <br><li>Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over each ring; flip and grate more cheese<br>on the other side. Flip back to the first side and apply one last grating of cheese,<br>or until rings are thoroughly coated. </li>
            <br><li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and crunchy, 25 to 30 minutes.<br>Remove from the baking sheet onto a wire rack and let cool completely before<br>serving. </li>
        </ol>
