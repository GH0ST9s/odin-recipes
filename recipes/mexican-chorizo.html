        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mexican chorizo is a little different than its Spanish cousin, but equally delicious.<br>
            Use these sausages as you would any spicy sausage, or use the loose sausage meat to make<br>
            tacos for a flavor-packed change from regular old ground pork. Freeze for up to 3 months.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>15 dried red chile peppers, seeded</li>
            <li>2.1/4 pounds boneless, skinless pork butt, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>7 ounces pork fat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>5 whole allspice berries</li>
            <li>5 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cider vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoonn ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 hog casing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chile peppers in a bowl and cover with hot water. Soak until softened,<br>about 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, place pork butt and pork fat in the freezer for 30 minutes. Chill meat<br>grinder in the freezer to make grinding the meat easier.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Grind allspice berries and cloves using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drain chile peppers and place in a food processor or blender. Add vinegar and<br>puree until smooth.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Fit the chilled meat grinder with a medium plate. Pass the partially frozen pork<br>
                and fat through the grinder. Combine ground meat with pureed chile peppers, garlic,<br>
                oregano, salt, pepper, and cumin in a bowl. Mix well with your hands for 2-3 minutes.<br>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour, or overnight.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, soak casing in cold water for about 30 minutes. Place the wide end<br>
                of a small sausage-stuffing funnel up against the sink tap and run cold water<br>
                through the inside of the casing.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use the medium sausage-stuffing funnel attachment and place casing on the<br>
                outside of the tube. Start passing meat mixture through the funnel, stopping<br>
                just as it starts to come out the other end. Tie the casing into a knot at the end,<br>
                then continue passing the meat mixture through the funnel, supporting the<br>
                sausage with your other hand. Once the meat mixture is finished, tie the other<br>
                end of the casing into a knot.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Twist the casing at regular intervals to create individual links, alternating<br>between twisting in opposite directions. Poke 2-3 small holes into each<br>sausage with a metal skewer to allow air to escape during cooking.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook as desired or chill in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
